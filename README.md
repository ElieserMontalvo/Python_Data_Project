# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from Luke Barousse's Python Course which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions
### Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

- What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
- How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
- How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
- What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)
# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
- Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.
- Matplotlib Library: I visualized the data.
- Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.
- Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# Data Preparation and Cleanup
#### This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

# Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.
```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```
# Filter US Jobs
To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.
```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```

 # The Analysis

 Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1.What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)

    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')
    if i != len(job_titles) -1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested In US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) # fix the overlap
plt.show()

# Adjust layout and display plot 
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results
![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US](3_Project/images/Most_Optimal_Skills.png)
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US.*

### Insights
- The scatterplot shows that programming skills (in blue) such as python and sql are the most optimal skills for Data Analysts. They seem to be the highest paying while also showing up on a large percent of Data Analysts roles. As all of the skills lay above the $90k range and span throughout most of the analyst jobs range, some reaching up to 58%.

- Both Databases (in green) and Clouds (in red) show high potential in salary, however they lack in Data Analyst jobs
which shows they might not be as optimal to learn as a Data Analyst when compared to other skills & tools.

-  Analyst tools (in orange) are the most diverce in the scatterplot, showing some skills as very optimal due to the high salary and large percent of jobs, while others show among the lowest salary and little showings in Data Analyst jobs. It's also good to keep in mind that the popular analyst tools seem to be most optimal for Data Analysts such as tableau and power bi.
